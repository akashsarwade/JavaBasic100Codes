Encapsulation

Encapsulation in java is a mechanism of wrapping the data(variable) and code
acting on the data (method) together as a single entity

Steps to achieve Encapsulation
1. 	Declare the variable of class Encapsulation a private
2.	provide public getter and setters method to modify view the variables values


What is Data Hiding ?
Making data members as a private is called data hiding.
other classes won't access this class data
